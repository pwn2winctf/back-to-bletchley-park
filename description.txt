We have gone quantum. A collaborator of ours built this quantum circuit to
compute the factorization of a Bavs RSA key and took note of the results.
Unfortunatly we could not get in touch with her lately, so we need your
help undestanding what she did. Once we figure out the circuit and
discover what are the values of A and N, we can run it through her script to
decode the message. We don't trust you enough yet, so give us the values of
A and N, and if we can decrypt the message, we'll tell you the result she got
so you too can decrypt the message.
